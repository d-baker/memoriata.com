<em>
There is so much of transcendence<br/>
That I haven't got to know yet<br/>
As the universe is endless<br/>
And my will to live relentless,<br/>
My soul is restless<br/><br/>
Why's it so hard to let go<br/>
of all the ways I want to grow?<br/>
All the inner fire wasted<br/>
All the pleasures never tasted<br/>
I won't know<br/><br/>
There's so much to stay alive for<br/>
There are people I would die for<br/>
Rules to break and dreams to reach for<br/>
Have I lived enough already to make up for… ?<br/><br/>
I'm not ready to die<br/><br/>
After everything I've been through<br/>
I have learnt what really matters and it's you<br/>
and every lifeform on this miracle of nature, green and blue<br/><br/>
Even though I've lost so much<br/>
I still can't believe my luck<br/>
I've been granted many blessings<br/>
Never take for granted anything<br/><br/>
And I know I've left it all<br/>
All the aspirations of yore<br/>
And I know to let them go<br/>
All the places I would go<br/>
I won't go

- description: "I started writing the first movement of the Piano Trio during the Melbourne International Chamber Music competition in July 2011, which I was listening to on the radio with great interest. I've never actually liked the piano trio genre (piano, cello and violin) much, aside from Ravel's trio. I think it's a slightly odd combination of instruments. but listening to MICMC inspired me and I wanted to write something really technical and inspired by the rhythms and riffs of heavy metal to some extent. (unfortunately I think the technicality may have made it almost unplayable for the cello and violin, but as the only instrument I play is the piano I can't judge...)<br><br>At the beginning of 2012 I came up with a melody which formed the basis for the 2nd movement of the trio, with similar kind of influences but more lyrical. The 3rd movement is largely based on a rock song I wrote at the start of 2011; and the 4th movement is sort of a development on some of the themes in the other movements, and a further exploration of the techniques I used in the second half of the 1st movement. It's also influenced a little by my growing interest in minimalism.<br><br>This is the 1st movement. Although most of the piece is meant to be as strict and rythmic as possible, at one point I added a contrasting ad libitum section and the full effect doesn't come across in sibelius playback, which is somewhat limited :( I also still can't get sibelius to play back directions for spiccato, so there are some fast spiccato sections in the strings in the second half which still sound like pizzicato."

- description: "This is the 2nd movement of the piano trio I started writing in the middle of 2011. It actually started out as a song with piano accompaniment. I'm not very good at writing songs/lyrics though, and at some point it occurred to me it could form the basis for the 2nd movement of the piano trio (at that point it only consisted of a few bars of the melody with accompaniment and the first theme in the piano part.) So I gave the melody to the violin and it just grew from there.<br><br>This movement was inspired partly by traditional english/irish folk music, as well as the heavy metal influences that were present in the first movement.<br><br>The Sibelius output on this track sounds really horrible in my opinion (the melody in the beggining should be really expressive and with lots of rubato.) Also, most of the stuff that sounds like pizzicato in the strings is meant to be spiccato (mostly the semiquaver passages which would probably be unplayable if they were pizz.) because stupid sibelius won't play back my directions for spiccato :|"

I ended up adding to or changing so much of the material that the only part that remains completely true to the original is the first 'chorus' (0:47 - 1:32) This was what I intended, as I wanted to expand substantially on the initial themes.<br><br>Unfortunately Sibelius won't play back the dynamics in the last part (3:56 onwards) properly. The piano part is meant to be 'piano', but Sibelius ignored my markings and kept playing it back 'forte'. So you'll just have to imagine it quieter :("

- description: "During late 2010/early 2011 I worked furiously at this 17-track atrocity in Garageband, which ended up being practise for juggling a whole orchestra in Sibelius. I started this piece first, but was still working on it when I started to write my orchestral suite ('Time Capsule'). In a way, I consider Lullaby of Broken Hearts (acronym LOBH) to be my first foray into serious composition (by which I mean, considered and planned musical writing. Of course I 'wrote' music before that.)<br><br>Because I love the material in this piece and it marks my first attempt at composing seriously, I have since tried again and again to incorporate the material into conventional classical pieces. I've tried orchestrating it several times, turning it into a piano concerto, a piano solo...the only vaguely succesfull attempt was 3rd movement of my piano trio, which I like, but which doesn't convey what the original does. In the end I realised LOBH only worked in its electronic form. There's just one problem though...<br><br>Somehow, in the process of chopping up and manipulating Garageband drum loops, I managed to get a loop that was not quite a full bar in length. As a result, all the rhythms are slightly lopsided. This made recording all 17 tracks on top of the drum loops an absolute nightmare, and believe it or not, at the time I had no idea a faulty loop was to blame. I just thought I either had a terrible sense of rhythm or the midi input was laggy.<br><br>Anyway, when I finally discovered the problem, there was no way I was going to re-record everything (I can't even remember how to play it now). When I listened to some of the tracks separately, they were a rhythmic mess, but with all 17 playing at once the texture was so dense you'd barely notice the fault (unless you play it along with a metronome or you happen to be a percussionist.) I'm still hideously embarrassed by this failing though, especially in the point 3/4s of the way through with the very exposed, squawky metally riffs which were practically impossible to get together even with garageband's auto-alignment function switched on. That bit sounds absolutely awful, but I can't get rid of it; firstly, I generally refuse to revise old works, and secondly, it's part of the structure of the piece."

I eventually gave up, as it was obvious the only way it worked was as a purely computer-generated soundscape.<br><br>I'm emotionally attached to this piece so it's hard for me to tell whether it's actually of any worth musically or not. That's for you to judge."
