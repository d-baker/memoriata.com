- description: "I am a huge admirer of Rachmaninov's playing and aspire to the same crystal clarity and dextrous navigation of texture that can be heard in his playing. To prepare for this performance I listened to Rachmaninov's own recording of this piece on repeat for several days before the concert. I was particularly eager to perform this piece on an instrument built during Rachmaninov's lifetime, as it produces a tone similar to that of the pianos Rachmaninov would have played."
