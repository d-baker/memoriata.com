  - description: "This is a setting of the traditional folksong \"She's like the swallow\". I started working on this piece at the end of 2011. The music is all original except a tiny excerpt at the end, in the final chorus, where the soprano sings a slightly modified version of the traditional tune over the top of my own melody.<br><br>The score can be downloaded <a href=\"http://memoriata.com/scores.html\">here</a>."
