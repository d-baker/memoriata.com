My goal in making solo recordings of major piano works like this (I've done it a few times in the past) was always to cement - to set in stone, if you will - the interpretation I wanted to strive for. At the time I made this recording, I probably thought it was quite bad, but now with some distance from it (and having not had the opportunity to learn or perform anything this challenging for a very long time), I can see just how well I achieved that goal. Yes, I had to splice parts of it. Yes, it doesn't flow very well as a result. But that wasn't the point of the recording. The point was to prove to myself that I could play an entire movement of a piano concerto in the vintage style I admire...and I did that!"

- description: "I came across this piece while perusing several large volumes of Bach's organ works, and my initial encounter with it was on the organ. The experience of sight-reading it was like a journey through a winding maze that held some new and unexpected gem around every corner. It struck me as unlike any Bach I'd ever heard before - extremely simple, almost uncharacteristically so, yet full of surprisingly modern harmonies and progressions. So when I took it to the piano, I decided to do something very different with it - I interpreted it romantically, as if it were a Chopin prelude. I would never usually approach a piece of Bach in this manner, but I felt it was fitting for this work."

- description: "The reason for this historically incorrect performance of renaissance choral music on a modern piano is that I wanted to use it as an example in my <a href=\"http://dorotheabaker.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/the-chord-progression-of-resignation.html\"> list of music containing the chord progression of resignation.</a><br><br>This piece was part of a concert programme my choir did, and of all the pieces we learnt, this was my favorite. The beginning was haunting me, and at some point it occurred to me to test whether it used the aforementioned chord progression, considering the feeling I got from it. Even though I suspected it, I was still surprised when the progression in the first few bars turned out to be Im, VI, IVm, Im. <br>I could have JUST recorded those bars for my example list, but I love the whole piece so much I thought I'd share all of it.<br><br>p.s. my mother, a talented soprano and tenor (yes you read that correctly) recorded a no less historically incorrect, but considerably more beautiful rendition of this piece in which she sang the tenor part up the octave while I played the other parts at normal pitch on organ.
