<h1 class="headline">I do lots of different things.</h1>

<div class="textblock col1 homepage">
    <h2 class="avpg">Music</h2>
    <p>I'm a composer of strange, arguably electronic music; a classical pianist; classical-contemporary composer; singer; and some-time church musician and music director. I like to write arrangements of Celtic and other traditional folk music.</p>
<!--     <p>I'm an <a target="_blank" href="https://memoriata.bandcamp.com/album/yesterlieder">electronic musician</a>, classical pianist</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://memoriata.bandcamp.com/album/berceuses">classical-contemporary composer</a>, singer and some-time church musician. I often write arrangements of <a href="/music/audio/originalcomps/T_m_mo_shu2017-08-29.html" target="_blank">Celtic and other traditional folk music</a>.</p> -->

<!--     <p>I have strong feelings about pianistic style, specifically pedalling and the technique of early 20th century virtuosos. This has lead me to analyse vintage recordings of pianists such as Rachmaninov in order to study, and <a href="/music/audio/pianorecs/concert2017-10-15/Rachmaninov_Prelude_Op_32_No_5.html" target="_blank">attempt to emulate</a>, their technique.</p> -->

    <p>I sometimes <a target="_blank" href="/music/mechanisms/">combine my love of technology and music</a>.</p> -->

    <h2 class="geekpg">Tech</h2>
    <p>I'm a professional UX designer, former web developer, a Linux devotee, and an all-round nerd. I get excited about spreadsheets, truth tables, and highly configurable systems (hello, KDE).</p>
    <p>There used to be a link to a page about all my tech projects here, but I had to let a domain expire, so all the links are broken and I've temporary removed my tech projects page until I fix them. Sorry!</p>
<!--     <p>I occasionally find myself <a target="_blank" href="blog/horrorstory.html">delving deep into the guts of Unix</a>, and I enjoy <a href="https://github.com/d-baker/clevo-keyboard-backlight-control" target="_blank">trying to automate things</a> - even if I don't always succeed.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in artistic applications of technology such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/d-baker/NaNoGenMo-2014">natural language processing</a> and <a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/visualiser" target="_blank">audio analysis</a>.</p>

    <p>Coming soon...maybe...</p>
    <p>In the meantime you can read some of my creative writing on my blog, though most of what is on my blog is <em>not</em> creative writing.</p>
