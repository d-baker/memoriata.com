    <h2 class="avpg"><a href="/music/">Music</a></h2>
    <p>I'm an electronic musician, classical pianist, classical-contemporary composer, singer and some-time church musician.</p>
    <p>I'm a purist with regards to piano technique (especially pedalling) and I love traditional folk music (especially of the Celtic variety).</p>

    <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="/tech/">Tech</a></h2>
    <p>I'm a professional web developer, Linux devotee, and all-round nerd.</p>
<p> I get excited about truth tables, UX design, Unix administration and highly configurable systems (hello, KDE). If something tedious needs doing on a computer, I enjoy trying to automate it...even if I don't always succeed.</p>
