    <p>I'm an <a target="_blank" href="https://dbaker.bandcamp.com/album/yesterlieder">electronic musician</a>, classical pianist</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dbaker.bandcamp.com/album/berceuses">classical-contemporary composer</a>, singer and some-time church musician.</p>
    <p>I'm a purist with regards to piano technique (especially pedalling) and I love traditional folk music (especially of the Celtic variety).</p>
<!--     <p>I often write arrangements of <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/music/audio/originalcomps/T_m_mo_shu2017-08-29/" target="_blank">Celtic and other traditional folk music</a>. I'm also inspired my 20th century minimalism, progressive rock and metal, and various ambient and electronic genres.</p>

    <p>I have strong feelings about pianistic style, specifically pedalling and the technique of early 20th century virtuosos. This has lead me to analyse vintage recordings of pianists such as Rachmaninov in order to study, and <a href="/music/audio/pianorecs/concert2017-10-15/Rachmaninov_Prelude_Op_32_No_5/" target="_blank">attempt to emulate</a>, their technique.</p>

    <p>I've been known to <a target="_blank" href="/music/mechanisms/">combine my love of technology and music</a>.</p> -->

    <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="/tech/">Tech</a></h2>
    <p>I'm a professional web developer, Linux devotee, and all-round nerd.</p>
<p> I get excited about truth tables, UX design, and highly configurable systems (hello, KDE), and I occasionally find myself <a target="_blank" href="http://nightmare.website/2016/10/13/horrorstory.html">delving deep into the guts of Unix</a>.</p>
<!--         <p>In my free time I design, build and maintain various personal websites, including this one. If something tedious needs doing on a computer, I enjoy trying to automate it...even if I don't always succeed.</p>
    <p>I have a particular interest in the artistic applications of technology such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/d-baker/NaNoGenMo-2014">natural language processing</a> and <a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/visualiser" target="_blank">audio analysis</a>.</p> -->
