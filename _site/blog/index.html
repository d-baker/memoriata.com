        <article class="post-content">
          <p>For a long time I’ve been meaning to write something about my language learning process and never really managed it. Rather than talking about my procrastination I think I’ll just cut straight to the point this time.</p>

<p>I’m kind of in love with languages of all kinds, natural, programming, musical…every time I discover a new one, I want to learn it. I was developing a ridiculously long list of languages I wanted to learn, so a year ago, out of desperation, I recklessly decided to start learning 5 at once (vocabulary only; grammar would have been too difficult). I chose Russian, Irish, Finnish, Norwegian and French.</p>

<p>Although far from my first foray into language learning - in the past I’ve dabbled in Latin, Greek and French, and I spent quite a lot of time in 2013 learning Russian - I’d never been very good at committing to anything for more than a short period of time. I’d tried language kits, Anki, textbooks and foreign language book translations without managing to stick with any for very long. I figured it was time to take matters into my own hands and formulate my own way of doing things. Here follows a very much simplified explanation of what I came up with.</p>

<p>Although it’s evolved over time, and I’ve added new languages, the overall idea remains the same: I have a spreadsheet with a separate sheet for each language (currently all the languages mentioned earlier, plus Japanese, Icelandic and Polish). One column contains a list of English words, each of which is a hyperlink to the pronunciation of that word on <a href="forvo.com">Forvo</a>. One column is for notes and hints, and then there are 2 columns dedicated to the date I learnt the word and the date I next need to revise the word, respectively.</p>

<p>The calculation of revision dates - which is based on powers of 2 - is entirely manual and also subject to arbitrary adjustment, depending on how well I feel I’ve remembered a word.</p>

<p>I’ve now been learning vocabulary for over a year using this technique, and it’s surprisingly effective. The biggest change in my revision technique was forcing myself to type out each word as I revised it in a text file, something I decided to try after feeling like I wasn’t really paying enough attention to words as I revised them: not only does this test my spelling, but it has also taught me to touch-type in Cyrillic to some extent. Although I’m prone to off-by-one errors when trying to type in Cyrillic, I’ve started to get confused between keyboard layouts occasionally and try to type in English as though still using the Cyrillic layout!</p>

<p>This leads me to an interesting thing I’ve started to notice during the last couple of months. When I’m doing revision and see a word in the English word column, a foreign translation usually pops into my mind instantly - but it’s not always in the same language, and definitely not always in the language I’m actually meant to be revising.</p>

<p>The fact that different English words trigger a different “automatic” translation is something I find intriguing. Why is it that the first translation of “sorry” that comes to mind is the Finnish “anteeksi” rather than Norwegian “unsskyld”, while “every” is automatically Russian “кажды” rather than Irish “gach”, and “accident” is always Irish “timpiste” rather than Russian “аварии”? </p>

<p>I actually have trouble differentiating between translations for a specific English word because they’ve all come to mean the same thing to me in their own right. I’m not translating in my head anymore: the meaning is <em>embedded</em> in the foreign word itself (I imagine this is how fluent speakers feel about every foreign word).
As a result of this confusion I’ve frequently made the disconcerting mistake of “answering” in the wrong language when trying to revise vocab.</p>

<p>Perhaps a good analogy is the confusion that can come about when you’ve learnt several programming languages with subtly (or not-so-subtly) different syntax. I frequently find myself typing in some weird Python-Javascript-Java-C mish-mash with stray colons and semicolons and variable declarations all over the place:</p>

<pre><code>if bla:
	blabla;
	for (int bla = bla; bla; bla++) {
		blaaa
	}
else if bla:
	$("bla").bla;
</code></pre>

<p>(note: the above programming language does not exist.)</p>

<p>Here’s a very simple example with <em>natural</em> languages (grammar is completely fake btw):
это jeudi tänään ach я не ag oibre</p>

<p>that is:
russian-french-finnish-irish-russian-russian-irish-irish</p>

<p>For some reason I find the above nonsensical phrase easier to understand than if it was all in one language. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

          <p>I have a thing for memorising strings of numbers. I’ve committed numerous card/account/phone numbers to memory, and that’s useful as it saves having to check every time the number is needed for something. But recently I embarked on an exercise in numerical memorisation which has no practical application whatsoever.</p>

<p>I’ve read about people memorising so-and-so digits of pi and it always struck me as one of those signature nerd things to do. I guess that’s what appealed to me, in the end. I wanted to be one of <em>those</em> nerds. Plus, memorising numbers is just fun, and I wanted to challenge myself. 
So, a few months I added a card to Anki that had “recite pi” on the front and 3.14159265358 on the back. I used the <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/math/pi">pi command</a> to get the digits, and I plan on stopping when I reach the end of the default number of decimal places printed (since the precision determines the digits anyway, I can’t exactly increase it now).</p>

<p>I can’t remember what I did to start with, but I’ve fallen into a pattern of learning 4 new digits at a time, appending them to the rest of the digits I already know. I highlight the newly-added digits in bold so I know which ones I need to be committing ot memory. This technique has had an interesting consequence.</p>

<p>The more digits I memorise, the easier it seems to get to memorise new ones. However, I’ve discovered that although I remember the sets of 4 digits that make up the entire number easily, I don’t necessarily remember what <em>order</em> those sets come in. To solve this problem, I’ve started giving myself hints as I recite, rather like I give myself hints when playing music on the piano from memory. Here’s an example.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, I can recite up to the following point almost glitch-free:
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375</p>

<p>Since repeated numbers kind of stand out, I used the repetition of the 9 as cue - a musical analogy is the “pickup point”, which every musician who’s played from memory will know about. After that point, though, I kind of got a bit lost. I knew the next 4 sets of 4 digits, but I couldn’t remember the order. That’s when I noticed a pattern.
The sets are actually in ascending order of their first digit:
1058
2097
4944
5932</p>

<p>As soon as I noticed that, I had no trouble remembering them. The final set of 4, however, caused me a little trouble. I had a simliar problem with the set “9375” earlier on - I knew what the digits were, but I couldn’t remember their order. Eventually, by forcing myself to recall the order of the first <em>two</em> digits, I was able to remember the entire set. This is also analogous to memorising music, where sometimes all it takes to memorise a tricky passage is forcing yourself to remember a small portion of it by making notes on the music to draw it to your attention, then practising it over and over again.</p>

<p>While memorising pi is a completely pointless endeavour, it’s strangely enjoyable to recite - even relaxing. And I can’t help but feel a silly sense of achievement when I realise I can recite pi to (at the time of writing) 68 places.</p>

        </header>

        <article class="post-content">
          <p>My NaNoGenMo project started out as an attempt at parodying bad literature, inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/">Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest</a>. I planned to take extremely cliched sentences like “It was a dark and stormy night” and use Python string formatting to generate a sentence with the same structure but with all or most of the nouns, adjectives, verbs and so on replaced with random selections from a wordlist. 
Anything rich in description, comparisons and metaphors could easily be broken down into parts of speech, which could then be substituted in this manner. Despite my original intentions, good writing featured prominently.</p>

<p>Until today, my code consisted of
<br />
- a prompt allowing the user to choose a name and pronoun to use throughout the novel<br />
- a list of functions that return formatted strings, from which functions are randomly selected and strung together with varying amounts of trailing whitespace<br />
- “storytelling functions” which return strings not based on existing sentences, and are responsible for any mentions of the protagonist</p>

<p>The problem with this was it lacked structure and direction, and I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to divide it into chapters. Chapters are by no means a prerequisite for NaNoGenMo, but there were a few reasons why I thought they were a good idea: firstly, nobody wants to read a 50000 word computer-generated novel from cover to cover and chapters make it easier to choose places to read from; and secondly, I was already trying to make something novel-like in scope and content, and chapters just made sense.</p>

<p>That’s when I had an idea.</p>

<p>Ever since I got into bot-making I’ve been procrastinating about learning to write my own sentence-construction code, possibly because I don’t really understand Markov chains. Rather than trying to understand someone else’s algorithm and probably getting frustrated and wasting a lot of time, I decided to invent my own system from scratch without referring to anything. </p>

<p>I made a list of sentences from a text file, and ran each sentence through a function that added every possible pair of adjacent words to a Python dictionary, where the key is a word and the value is a list of words that occurred immediately after that key in a sentence. A “pivot” word is randomly selected from a sentence and from that point on whatever remained of the sentence is replaced by a sequence of words chosen by their associations to each other in the dictionary. It worked much better than I’d hoped, but I don’t have a clue what I’m doing.</p>

<p>In the process of writing the chaining algorithm, I started thinking: what would happen if I used my initial string-formatted text to generate chained sentences, then fed the chained sentences back into the chaining algorithm?</p>

<p>Wonderful degeneration is what happens.</p>

<p>As it stands today, my novel consists of three chapters: the first is pure string formatting, and about as coherent as bot text can get; the second reads like a remix of the first, the sentences no longer adhering to the original structures but still mostly grammatical; the final chapter is thoroughly disjointed but oddly poetic. You could keep on feeding the chaining algorithm back into itself forever, and the results would get weirder and weirder. </p>

<p>I’ve already added code to allow the user to choose the length of the novel (the length of the chapters is calculated as a fraction), so why not also add code to allow choosing the number of chapters? It would require considerable refactoring, and it could get slow if someone decided to ask for 1000 chapters (since every chapter gets written to a separate file, then read in and concatenated) but it’s too tempting to see what the sentences would look like after being fed through the chaining algorithm 1000 times.</p>

<p>Looks like I’m participating in National Novel Degeneration Month.</p>

        <article class="post-content">
          <p>I spent 4 hours today hanging around on IRC and watching a livestream of nerds discussing twitter bots. It was fabulous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdqRII2occ">Bot Summit 2014</a> has reminded me to write down some of my own thoughts on bots. If it had occurred to me at the time (and I hadn’t lost my voice), I might have given a talk, but oh well…maybe next year.</p>

<p>I made my first bot in June this year, around the time when <a href="https://twitter.com/everyword">@everyword</a> ended, but the @everyword tribute-making party that ensued was only indirectly responsible. It’s mostly <a href="https://twitter.com/inky">@inky</a>’s fault I’m even making bots at all.</p>

<p>My first bot was not an everyword clone. Around the time of @everyword’s demise, <a href="https://twitter.com/butt_things">@butt_things</a> had just come to my attention, and it seemed blindingly obvious that there should also be a @bot_things. Thankfully, no-one else had thought of this yet. It was simple to implement, and the only new thing I had to learn was how to interact with the Twitter API, something which up until that point had been such a mystery to me that I wouldn’t have even known to call it “interaction with the Twitter API”. </p>

<p>The day I deployed my first bot, I was due to perform in a piano concert at midday, then immediately afterwards leave on a road trip for a short holiday. In what little time I had to spare between packing, practising, and trying to eat lunch, I somehow managed to write some Python code and install a cron job on my iMac to run <a href="https://twitter.com/bot_things">@bot_things</a>.</p>

<p>A few hours later I was in a hotel room with no way to control the bot at all, and I just had to hope for the best. It felt wonderfully dangerous.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next few days, I would frantically check my phone every half hour (the interval at which my bot was scheduled to tweet) and every time it was like witnessing a small miracle, as “bot &lt;x&gt;” appeared in my timeline. Then, on the day I was due to return home, something new happened.</p>

<p>buttbot started replying to botbot with <em><a href="https://twitter.com/bot_things/status/512418274470932481">corrections</a></em>.*
I had made a small dent in the twitter bot universe.</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the things I struggle with the most when trying to create stuff is that I can’t create anything worthwhile if I’m not sufficiently inspired/motivated, and so my creative output has always been slow and fraught with periods of unproductivity. But - as evidenced by the <a href="http://memoriata.com/bots.html">number I’ve managed to make so far</a> - I don’t seem to have this problem with bots. It’s got me thinking about what, exactly, is so appealing about botmaking as a creative outlet.</p>

<p>Firstly, bots are a very easy way to be prolific creatively. There are endless things that can be automated in a way suitable for distribution on twitter, and it doesn’t matter if the concept is extremely simple - in fact, some of the simplest concepts have become the most popular bots. Consider @everyword.
So coming up with the idea for a bot may well be the easiest part.</p>

<p>Secondly, once you have the concept, your work as an artist is done; now you step into the role of programmer, technician, craftsperson, whatever you want to call it. You are no longer drawing on your finite resources of inspiration to come up with ideas: now you’re just building a machine. That has challenges of its own, of course, but they aren’t the challenges of searching for inspiration.</p>

<p>And finally, once your machine is built and deployed, it becomes a living artwork of sorts, possibly extending outside of itself, conversing with humans and other bots, creating new things through interaction with its environment.</p>

<p>It boils down to this:
	You have an idea for a bot (fun, creative part of the process)
	You make a machine that executes the idea (possibly fun, possibly boring, possibly frustrating, but keeps you occupied until you have another idea)
	You deploy the machine and it continues to make art based on your idea, on a regular basis, for as long as you want it to, without the need for human intervention (mostly).</p>

<p>So you have an easy inception, a challenging but fun implementation, and ongoing rewards. Sounds like the ideal art form to me.</p>

<p>*botbot now corrects the corrections.</p>
