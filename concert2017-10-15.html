    <p>A selection of works recorded at a concert held by myself and my former piano teacher Stephen Kerr. All are performed by me, with the exception of the Ravel where Stephen joins me at the keyboard. </p>
    <p><strong>About the piano</strong></p>
    <p>The piano played in this concert is over a century old. Built by Berlin piano makers J. L. Duysen in 1914, it is an exquisitely crafted instrument and remains in remarkably good condition.</p>
    <p>Pianos built during the early 20th century had a warmer, mellower tone than the pianos of today. This makes them ideal for romantic and impressionistic repetoire, and provides insight into how composers of the time would have heard their music. I feel very privileged to have performed Ravel and Rachmaninov on a period instrument.</p>
