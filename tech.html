<div class="content-wrapper">

    <div class="wide textblock col1">
        <p>Back when I was a full-time computer science student, I did a lot of creative tech stuff. I more or less learnt to program by making Twitter bots in Python, and progressed to creating a variety of web apps mostly relating to art and music.</p>
        <p>Since getting a day job as a web developer, I no longer do much recreational programming, but my favorite projects from that technologically creative period of my life are archived below.
        </p>
        <p>My tech interests include UX (which I have a tendency to get into heated discussions about), natural language processing, the application of mathematical and programming concepts to art and music, and Unix administration. And for some reason I'm obsessed with truth tables, especially ones describing user interface behavior.</p>

            <p>nightmare.website began as a place to document the things I learnt during my computer science course. It was initially intended to be a collection of web design resources and inspiration, but ultimately expanded to include all computer-related topics.</p>
            <p>nightmare.website is both a reference for myself, and a way for me to document solutions to problems that I haven't been able to easily find answers for on Google, and make those solutions available to others.</p>
            <p>It hasn't been updated for a long time!</p>

            <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/visualiser/">Audio visualiser</a></h2>

            <p>I was inspired to do something creative with audio streaming in Javascript after reading a tutorial on using it to create waveform visualisations. This - the product of many hours of trial and error - was the result. It comes with a selection of tracks by myself and my friends.</p>
            <p>The visualiser uses PHP for track selection to enable bookmarking/linking of the selected track, and Javascript to stream MP3s, analyse the audio data and use the results in CSS values and other things.</p>
            <aside class="note">Known bug: visualisation does not work in iOS Safari due to lack of browser support for the visualisation technology.</aside>

            <p>I created this computer-generated novel for National Novel Generation Month, a project started by <a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions">Darius Kazemi</a>. It's written in Python and uses a corpus of hand-picked lines from novels (including some very famous ones), tied together with bigrams.</p>
            <p>I actually wrote a blog post about the process of creating the novel, which you can read <a href="/blog/nanogenmo">here</a>.
            <aside class="note">Note: a second, longer version is available <a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/dropbox/baroque_encodings_v2.pdf">here</a>. You can also create your own version by <a href="https://github.com/d-baker/NaNoGenMo-2014">downloading</a> and running the code.</aside>

            <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/botlang/">Botlang</a></h2>

            <p>Botlang was an attempt at creating a community-driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">conlang</a> via a Twitter bot.</p>
            <p>Written in Python, the bot analysed tweets sent to it and generated a "Bottish" translation for each word it found, then added the definition to a dictionary so it could look the word up in the future. This enabled the <a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/botlang/translator.html">translator</a> feature on the Botlang website.</p>
            <p>During lapses in conversation with other Twitter uses, the bot randomly pulled English words from a corpus and created Bottish translations for those in order to build up its vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I allowed Botlang and its website to fall into a state of disrepair. The Twitter bot is no longer running, but when I have time I'd like to start it up again and refactor the code using the knowledge I've gained since its creation.</p>

            <p>I made this simple generative "artwork" on a whim in 2015. Refresh the page to get a new design, scroll to navigate the artwork, and/or try resizing the browser window to mix things up a bit!</p>

            <p>Though hardly a great work of art, and extremely simple in construction, people seem to like this little thing I made in plain HTML with marquee tags. I hope you do too.</p>

            <aside class="note">This page was one of a number of things that came out of my time on <a href="http://tilde.club/">tilde.club</a>, a wonderful effort to recreate what could best be described as an old-school non-social-network.</aside>

            <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="http://dreadedvariable.xyz/portfolio/react-clock/">React Clock</a></h2>

            <p>I created this very minimal clock in order to teach myself the basics of React.js. At the time my analog wall clock had just broken, so I made this as a replacement, to be displayed throughout the day on a large, under-utilised desktop computer. I never got round to replacing my wall clock in the end!</p>
            <aside class="note">I'm well aware that I had a very specific use case for this app which probably nobody else will share. But here it is anyway!</aside>

            <h2 class="geekpg"><a href="https://memoriata.itch.io/glade">Glade</a></h2>

            <p>The only game I've ever created, made for the Fermi Paradox game jam on itch.io in 2016. I made it after learning Unity from scratch in a week, so it's, well, quite bad. I always meant to go and fix all the bugs and design problems, but never had the time.</p>
            <p>In this game, you pilot a small spaceship - which moves far too slowly - around the surreal, alien landscape of a foreign planet, and try to work out why it's so lifeless. If you play this game and actually get to the ending I'd love to know, because there are no clues to help you work out what to do (not by design; I didn't have time to add any).</p>
